# Strategic Hedge Fund Analysis and Portfolio Optimization

**Project Walk Through**: [YouTube](https://youtu.be/VuK6WECOp24)

In this project, we conducted in-depth analysis of hedge fund trades data, trying to replicate the Bloomberg Risk Model, focusing on optimizing the fund's performance. The project involved comprehensive stages of data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, clustering, and regression modeling. 

## Key Contributions

1. **Data Cleaning**: Transformed time data from strings to integers and managed missing data.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Visualized key variables using Sturges and Freedman-Diaconis rules for optimal histogram representation.
3. **Unsupervised Learning**: Performed K-Means and Gaussian Mixture models on 'profitPct' data for trade categorization.
4. **Feature Engineering**: Created 'bidAskSpreadPct' and 'fracBidVolume' features. Optimized 'tradedFloatPct' feature.
5. **Regression Modeling**: Developed a predictive model for 'entrySlipPct', assessed the impact of outliers, and enhanced model fit.
6. **Profitability Augmentation**: Proposed strategies to avoid less profitable trades and enhance portfolio performance.
7. **Emerging Industry Analysis**: Analyzed the Electric Vehicles industry using KMeans and GMM.
8. **Investment Proposals**: Found new investment ideas aligning with the current portfolio using nearest neighbors algorithm.
9. **Competitive Recommendations**: Used the Apriori algorithm to derive insights from competitors.
